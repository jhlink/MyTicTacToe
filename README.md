Submission Notes:

 - Object Pooling wasn't implemented in the project. The technique seems to be mostly useful towards applications with variable quantities of objects, whereas in this project there is always a constant number of pieces assuming that the grid is still 3x3.
 - Shadows are either static and baked or have been removed. This can be seen especially when moving pieces during game play don't cast shadows.
